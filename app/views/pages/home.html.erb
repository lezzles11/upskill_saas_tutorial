		      <li>Define Problem: Building a website to sell glasses</li>
		      <li>Research the issue: I think ultimately, I know that building my own website is key <br> You get to control user experience, and there is more flexibility. </li>
		      <li>Brainstorm Solutions: Perhaps to plan out and strategize what I need to learn <br> What are my first goals? <br> I think it is to first create a website and run it independently </li>
		      <li>Choose the best solution: Use Ruby on Rails and learn everything about Ruby <br> We can learn about other programming languages later. </li>
		      <li>Build the model: More practically, I think this means building the curriculum. <br> So there is the actual programming: Ruby on Rails. <br> There is also the designing of the first shitty draft: Illustrator and Photoshop <br> Then there is the database piece - SQL <br> There is also the API piece (interacting with different objects) </li>
